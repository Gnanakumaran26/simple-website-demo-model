    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The word "college" is from the Latin verb lego, legere, legi, lectum, "to
      collect, gather together, pick", plus the preposition cum, "with",[4] thus
      meaning "selected together". Thus "colleagues" are literally "persons who
      have been selected to work together". In ancient Rome a collegium was a
      "body, guild, corporation united in colleagueship; of magistrates,
      praetors, tribunes, priests, augurs; a political club or trade guild".[5]
      Thus a college was a form of corporation or corporate body, an artificial
      legal person (body/corpus) with its own legal personality, with the
      capacity to enter into legal contracts, to sue and be sued. In mediaeval
      England there were colleges of priests, for example in chantry chapels;
      modern survivals include the Royal College of Surgeons in England
      (originally the Guild of Surgeons Within the City of London), the College
      of Arms in London (a body of heralds enforcing heraldic law), an electoral
      college (to elect representatives); all groups of persons "selected in
      common" to perform a specified function and appointed by a monarch,
      founder or other person in authority. As for the modern "college of
      education", it was a body created for that purpose, for example Eton
      College was founded in 1440 by letters patent of King Henry VI for the
      constitution of a college of Fellows, priests, clerks, choristers, poor
      scholars, and old poor men, with one master or governor, whose duty it
      shall be to instruct these scholars and any others who may resort thither
      from any part of England in the knowledge of letters, and especially of
      grammar, without payment".[6]The word "college" is from the Latin verb
      lego, legere, legi, lectum, "to collect, gather together, pick", plus the
      preposition cum, "with",[4] thus meaning "selected together". Thus
